## About

For this application I have built a software engineering team generator command line based application.  The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. Using this input of information the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. This application is intended to pass all user tests.

 
User Story:
As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.
